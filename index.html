            <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
            <p>
                <span>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span>(15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian<br>
                aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and<br>
                raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the<br>
                next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and<br>
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was<br>
                intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.<br>
                He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of<br>
                ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,<br> technical,
                and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original<br> nuclear
                test by India in 1974.
